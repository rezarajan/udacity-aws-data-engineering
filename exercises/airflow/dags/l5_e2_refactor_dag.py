#Instructions
#In this exercise, weâ€™ll refactor a DAG with a single overloaded task into a DAG with several tasks with well-defined boundaries
#1 - Read through the DAG and identify points in the DAG that could be split apart
#2 - Split the DAG into multiple tasks
#3 - Add necessary dependency flows for the new tasks
#4 - Run the DAG
