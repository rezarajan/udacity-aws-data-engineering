## Project Overview
### 1 - [Data Modelling with Apache Cassandra](projects/1%20-%20Data%20Modelling%20with%20Apache%20Cassandra/)
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

They'd like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.

Skills Tested:
- CQL
- Python
- NoSQL Data Modelling

### 2 - [Data Warehouse](projects/2%20-%20Data%20Warehouse/)
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to.

Skills Tested:
- SQL
- AWS Redshift
- Python (boto3)
- Dimensional Data Modelling
